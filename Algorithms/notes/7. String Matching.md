## Brute Force

- Basic idea: Check the pattern starting at every text position, trying to match
    any substring of length m in the text with the pattern
- Pseudocode
    ```python
    NAIVE-STRING-MATCHING(T, P) 
        n = T.length
        m = P.length
        for s = 0 to n - m do
            if P[1, m] == T[s+1, s+m] then
                print "Pattern occurs with shift" s
    ```
- Time complexity: $O(nm)$

## The Rabin-Karp Algorithm

- Basic idea: Compare a string's hash values rather than the strings themselves.
    For efficiency, the hash value of the next position in the text is easily
    computed from the hash value of the current position
    - If the hash values are inequal, the algorithm will calculate the hash
          value for the next m-character sequence
    - If the hash values are equal, the algorithm wiil compare the pattern with
        the m-character sequence
- A hashing function `hash` should has the following properties:
    - Efficiently computable
    - Highly discriminating for strings
- We choose $hash(k) = k \mod p$ as the hash function, where $q$ is a large
  prime
- Time complexity: $O(nm)$

## String matching with finite autumata

- A DFA is a quintuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, F)$
    - $Q$: the finite set of states
    - $\Sigma$: the finite input alphabet
    - $\delta$: the transition function from $Q \times \Sigma$ to $Q$
    - $s \in Q$: the start state
    - $F \subset Q$: the set of final (accepting) states
- A DFA induces a state function $\Phi: \Sigma^* \to Q$ such that $\Phi(\omega)$
    is the state $M$ ends up in after reading the string $\omega$
    - $\Phi(\epsilon) = q_0$
    - $\Phi(\omega a) = \delta(\Phi(\omega), a)$
- Suffix function $\sigma$: checks to see how much of what it is reading matches
    the search string at any given moment
    - $\sigma(x) = max\{k: P_k \sqsupset x\}$
        - e.g. $P = abaabc, \sigma(abbaba) = 3$, because $P_3 = aba$ is the
          suffix of $abbaba$
- For any pattern $P$ of length $m$, we can define its string matching automata
    - state: $Q = \{0, \ldots, m\}$, the current state indicates the length of
        characters that have been matched
    - start state: $q_0 = 0$
    - accepting states: $F = {m}$
    - $\delta(q, a) = \sigma(P_q a)$
- Computer Transition Function:
    - Pseudocode
        ```python
        COMPUTE-TRANSITION-FUNCTION(P, Sigma)
            m = P.length
            for q = 0 to m do                       # O(m)
                for each character a in Sigma do    # O(|Sigma|)
                    k = min(m, q + 1)
                    while P_k is not a suffix of {P_q a} do # O(m) for O(m) times
                        k = k - 1
                    delta(q, a) = k                 # delta(q, a) = sigma(P_q a)
            return delta
        ```
    - Time complexity: $O(m^3|\Sigma|)$
- Finite Automation Matcher
    - Pseudocode
        ```python
        FINITE-AUTOMATION-MATCHER(T, delta, m)
            n = T.length
            q = 0
            for i = 1 to n do
                q = delta(q, T[i])
                if q == m then
                    s = i - m
                    print "Pattern occurs at shift" s
        ```
    - Time complexity: $O(n)$
- Time complexity: $O(n + m^3|Sigma|)$

## The KMP Algorithm

- Basic idea: The prefix function $\pi$ encapsulates knowledge about how
    the pattern matches against shifts of itself. We take advantage of this
    information to avoid testing useless shifts
    - $\pi[q] = max\{k: k < q \&\& P_k \sqsupset P_q\}$
- Compute Prefix Function
    - Pseudocode
        ```python
        COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION(P)
            m = P.length
            let pi[1, m] be a new array
            pi[1] = 0
            k = 0
            for q = 2 to m do
                # match failed, try a shorter string
                while k > 0 and P[k + 1] != P[q] do
                    k = pi[k]
                # match succesfully, length++
                if P[k + 1] == P[q] then
                    k = k + 1
                pi[q] = k
            return pi
        ```
- KMP match
    - Pseudocode
        ```python
        KMP-MATCHER(T, P)
            n = T.length
            m = P.length
            pi = COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION(P)
            q = 0
            for i = 1 to n do
                while q > 0 and P[q + 1] != T[i] do
                    q = pi[q]       # shift the pattern to the right
                if P[q + 1] == T[i] then
                    q = q + 1
                if q == m then
                    print "Pattern occurs with shift" i - m
                    q = pi[q]   # look for the next match
        ```
    - Time complexity: $O(m + n)$
- Summary
    - Build $\pi$ from pattern
    - Run $\pi$ on text
    - $O(m + n)$ worst case string search, good efficiency for texts with much
        repetition and less useful for text strings
