# Approximation Basics

## The vertex cover problem

- Vertex Cover: A vertex cover of a graph G is a set of vertices $V_c$ such that
    every edge in G has at least one of vertex in $V_c$ as an endpoint

## The set cover problem

- Set Cover: Given a finite set $X$ and a family $f$ of subsets of $X$, such 
    that every element of $X$ belongs at least one subset in $f$. The problem
    is find a minimum-size subset $l \subseteq f$ whose members cover all of
    $X$

## Knapsack

- Greedy algorithm redux is a $2-approximation$ algorithm
- Actually, we can achieve $(1 + \epsilon)-approximation$ for any $\epsilon >
  0$ by Dynamic Programming

## Summary

- For all the problems mentioned above, greedy algorithm perform badly
