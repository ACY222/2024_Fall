# NP-Completeness

## Some examples

- 3-SAT
- Maximum Independent Set

## P & NP

- P(Polynomial) = problems that can be solved in polynomial time
- NP(Non-deterministic Polynomial) = problems that can be verified in 
    polynomial time
- If we can solve a problem in polynomial time, then we can verify the problem
    in polynomial time. Namely, $P \subseteq NP$

## Reduction

- If we can solve problem B effectively, and A can be reduced to B in polynomial
    time, then we can solve A effectively
- In some sense, if A can be reduced to B in polynomial time, then we can say 
    problem A is "easier" or at least "no harder" than B. Denoted by $A \leq_p
    B$
    - It can be proved that $3-SAT \leq_p Maximum Independent Set$

## NP-hard, NP-complete

- NP-hard: $B$ is NP-hard if every problem $A \in NP, A \leq_p B$
    - $B$ may be not in NP
- NP-complete: $B$ is NP-complete if $B$ is NP-hard and $B \in NP$
- How to prove?
    - Cook's theroem: Every problem $A \in NP, A \leq_p SAT$
