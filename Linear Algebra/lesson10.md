# The Four Fundamental Subspaces

* column-space C(A)
* null-space N(A)
* row-space = all combinations of rows of A = all combinations of column-space
   of $A^T$ = $C(A^T)$
* null-space of $A^T$ = $N(A^T)$ = left null-space of A

We can see that, $C(A), N(A^T) \in R^m$, $N(A), C(A^T) \in R^n$

$dim(C(A^T)) = dim(C(A)) = r$

$dim(N(A)) = n - r, dim(N(A^T)) = m - r$

pivot columns give a basis to C(A), while all the special solutions give a basis
to N(A)(in which one of the free variables are set to be one while the others
are set to be 0)

$A \to R, C(R) \neq C(A)$, different column spaces, but same row spaces,
because there are row combinations in the row reduction process.

Considering $N(A^T)$
