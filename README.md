# 2024 Fall

This repository is used to record what I learned in 2024 fall semester. Many of
the contents are courses from USTC, such as Algorithms, Compile and Computer
Networking. They are all high-quality courses and I learned a lot from them.
Others are extracurricular, for example, the Linear Algebra is from Gilbert
Strang, MIT 18.06. I'm grateful to all of them.

The reason I build this is that with it I can find what I want easily when I
need to revise some of the courses in the future. And it can remind me doing
something meaningful rather than just lying in the dormitory.

I need to change something
